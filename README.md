# Fake-news-detection
This is the meachine learning model of the fake news dectection and this model have accuracy 99% but it  did'nt predect the present real news. 
we should consider deffarent parameters to judge a news as ture are false.
We need evidence to prove whether the news is true or false. Otherwise, there is a chance of true news exposure like fake news which is a big problem,
so for checking news fact checkers are there, they will check whether the news is true or fake. 
These fact-checkers consider some steps to check the news.

They see the aim of that claim in the news.
Who said that claim?
What do other people say about that claim?
They check reports regarding the topic on which the claim came.
In this predection we are not considering any of above , But this is the good prediction model for the beginners to analyse the working of machine learning
